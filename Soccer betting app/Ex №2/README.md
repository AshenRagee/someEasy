Continue using the previously used game variable.
1. Loop through the game.scored array and print the name of each player to the console along with the goal number (example: ‚ÄúGoal 1 - Kroos‚Äù)
2. Use a loop to calculate the average odd and print it to the console
3. Print 3 odds to the console, but formatted, exactly like this:
Rate for REAL MADRID victory: 1.48
Rate for draw: 2.53
Rate for BARCELONA victory: 4.25
Get team names directly from the game object, don't hardcode them
4. Bonus: create an object called goalScorers that contains the names of the players who scored as properties and the number of goals as a value. In this game it will look like this:
      {
        Kroos: 1,
        Benzema: 1,
        Mingueza: 1
}
