// Problem 1
// We work on wheather forecast app, specifically on
// humidity feature for now. The most recent task
// is: "Calculate the humidity amplitude for given array
// of humidities for one day. Note, that sometimes
// there can be an error in data, caused by sensor
// error."
// 1. understand the problem:
// - What is the humidity amplitude? this is the difference between min and max values in array?
// - How to calcilate min and max values in array?
// - What to do with error?

// 2. Divide into sub-problems
// - How to ignore data errors?
// - How to calculate min value in array?
// - How to calculate max value in array?
// - Subtract min from max and return the result

// Problem 2
// The function shoul get two arrays of humidities as paramenters
// 1. understand the problem:
// - Shoud we implement the same functionality for second array? - No, we should merge two arrays
// -
// -

// 2. Divide into sub-problems
// - How to merge 2 arrays?
